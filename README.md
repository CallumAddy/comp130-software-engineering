 What are the drawbacks in using the linear programming method to develop a game? 

Linear programming is when we program in a straight line so once something has been programmed you can’t go back to it as that would be going back on yourself and that isn’t linear. The issue with this is that if you make a mistake you can’t go back and fix it which can cause issues in the project, you’re working on however linear is said to be easier to work out how you want to do develop what you’re working on [1]. 
As I mentioned before Linear programming is in a straight line so you can kind of work out how much time each task will take you, if you run into problems in linear you could run into scoping issues and problems with time management. In my opinion programming a game in a linear programming method isn’t viable because you can’t expect to program a game without any bugs that would be naïve. 

Programming this way can cause a lot of issues as you’re not planning to encounter any issues with the game after you’ve moved on from the task you were working on, this can be very punishing.
